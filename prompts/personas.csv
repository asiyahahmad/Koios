Persona 1,A citizen scientist with a rare disease who has researched on their own and wants to explore data to understand comorbidities and disease outcomes to inform their decisions about treatments and raise disease & treatment awareness in their community.
Persona 2,"An undergraduate student at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution taking an Introductory Cloud Computing for Biology course that does not have any coding experience, has biological domain knowledge, and has limited time to complete the course projects (scale = weeks)."
Persona 3,A medical student taking clinical informatics or epidemiology graduate coursework who does not have access to controlled data and has limited access to large scale compute resources (cloud or HPC) due to limited institutional resources and expertise.
Persona 4,"A PhD student working in a disease specific wet lab at a research intensive university with only access to Open Data that needs to learn to write code, choose published tools/workflows to analyze -omics data, create replicable analyses for their lab, and collaborate with another lab as part of their PI’s research program."
Persona 5,"A postdoctoral scholar in population genetics at a research intensive university that needs to browse hosted data, perform harmonization between private data and hosted data, and write code that gathers metadata from multiple APIs in order to provide results to a consortium and support their K99/R00 application."
Persona 6,"An investigator writing a grant proposal regarding the connection between hypercholesterolemia and a specific related gene variant. They need to assess sample size, study feasibility, and available datasets, with the ability to add related terms relevant to their search and perform live harmonization (i.e. include terms such as hyperlipidemia) prior to requesting data."
Persona 7,"A staff scientist at a government organization (i.e. NIH) with deep computational expertise that has experience working with a large, private HPC and needs to harmonize datasets from a wide range of studies, request broader dbGaP permissions, transition pipelines from their HPC to the cloud to speed up association testing (e.g. wrapping a python pipeline with CWL), and provide summaries of results to their lab head."
Persona 8,"A computer science postdoc specializing in Machine Learning or AI for radiographic image analysis and integration with phenotypic information who wants to access hosted data, use the cloud to scale up their analysis from their private cluster, and publish tools they develop for other researchers to access."
Persona 9,An applied bioinformatician with a consortium Data Coordinating Center currently using AnVIL via pilot funds and needs to build and execute a data management and sharing strategy with a plan to submit data for hosting in BioData Catalyst.
Persona 10,A physician that is not affiliated with a research institution (i.e. community or private care) has a patient with a unique diagnosis and/or genetic variant and wants to investigate potential comorbidities with this phenotype/genotype.
Persona 11,A clinician researcher hypothesizes based on clinical experience and anecdotal data that some variants might be associated with hypertension. They want to perform hypothesis testing to see if and how those variants are related to diastolic blood pressure in order to better understand their patient population and solidify new research ideas.
Persona 12,A Physician-scientist at an academic medical center with disease specific interests that is developing preliminary evidence for a new grant application and needs access to dbGaP (or other controlled data) permission and find a collaborator with computational expertise.
Persona 13,"An industry clinician that runs a lab at a non-US institution without deep computational expertise, but wants to browse available data, share results from a published article, find new collaborators, and feel secure in data access restrictions on both private and hosted datasets."
Persona 14,A lab manager in an academic medical center working as part of a consortium that is building and executing a data management and sharing plan for clinical data the lab is generating.
Persona 15,"A computational expert in an academic medical center that needs dbGaP access to many studies and data modalities (imaging, clinical, genomic, phenotypic) to perform harmonization, verify/replicate published findings, and perform new meta-analysis."
Persona 16,A computer science PI with a private lab cluster that runs a lab developing and publishing tools for bioinformatic analysis funded through R01 grants and needs to manage costs and reporting of their postdocs and graduate students.
Persona 17,"An industry scientist at a large pharmaceutical company with access to a private HPC that needs to browse and gain access to hosted data, store and share experimental data, and review results generated by internal collaborators in order to advance the company’s therapeutic program."
Persona 18,A staff scientist at a research intensive university that needs access to controlled data in order to harmonize phenotypes across studies. They plan to share the harmonization results with their consortium through BioData Catalyst.
Persona 19,"A PI at a mid-tier university with some computational expertise and deep disease expertise that needs to monitor the progress of the research, track and review costs, request comprehensive summaries of progress to date, and oversee computational research progress of graduate students."
Persona 20,A faculty member at an HBCU without biomedical doctoral programs teaching a masters level course on medical informatics that needs to provide students with open access data and clear course/project guidelines.
Persona 21,"A PI at a research intensive university with domain specific expertise (e.g. stem cell biology) that needs to browse hosted data, monitor analysis of the lab’s private data, find computational scientists to collaborate with, and submit data to be hosted as part of their currently funded R01 research program."
